"In the current application, a multitude of proxy remote service calls are employed to provide the user interface with either remote data or remote eligibility information, which is subsequently utilized to render a tile or module on the dashboard. These proxy calls comprise distinct network requests initiated from the user interface, and they can be executed either in a sequential or parallel manner. In the context of each tile's dependence on individual remote APIs, the data's availability may vary in terms of speed, potentially resulting in a spinner-based user interface experience."



RDML, an acronym denoting "Remote Dashboard Module List," is envisioned as an extension built upon the preexisting Dashboard Module List (DML). RDML is designed to function as an experience service, with the primary responsibility of executing multiple remote API calls in parallel and consolidating the resulting remote data and eligibility information into a single, aggregated response that is then transmitted back to the user interface. The key objective of this architectural augmentation is to curtail the volume of network calls initiated by the user interface, thereby enabling it to issue a solitary RDML request to acquire all the requisite remote data for display on the dashboard.
